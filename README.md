# Fine Tuning and Ensembling Deep Architectures on Large Datasets in Resource Constrained EnvironmentÂ¶
The code in this file is used for fine tuning Resnet and Inception modules on ETHZ Food-101 dataset and test on UPMC Food-101 dataset. The base code is taken from the Deep Learning Programming Assignments and is modified and updated for the specific use of this project. Most of the rest of the code is our own work and the part where it is not is appropriately acknowledged.
